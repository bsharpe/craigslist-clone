## Setup & Installation

Railslist can be installed either on a Webserver or locally (Desktop). Irrespective where you install, it is assumed that the target system is already installed with Ruby, Rails, MySQL and ImageMagick/RMagick (used for captcha). Go for Phusion Passenger, if you have a dedicated or semi-dedicated hosting. Passenger offers faster performance.

## Prerequisites
